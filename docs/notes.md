# General notes

- [ ] Hosting Next.js client on Vercel
- [ ] Custom ChatGPT model - too expensive
- [ ] Run the 2GB llm model on a node.js backend and host on Oracle Cloud free tier (offers 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs which may not be enough)
- [ ] Create test suite using cypress
- [ ] Add CV to the project
- [ ] Deploy the CV and basic portfolio site on Vercel if the Oracle Cloud free tier is a blocker
